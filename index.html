       <h2>Section One</h2>
       <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components:

        Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, the atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.
        Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Exploring the Environment through Global Climate Change Education problem-based learning (PBL) website. The Center for Educational Technologies at Wheeling Jesuit University has expanded the popular Exploring the Environment website with funding from the NASA Innovations in Global Climate Change Education program. The new modules provide a comprehensive problem-based learning approach to the study of climate science.

            The new modules are designed to increase middle school and high school student climate literacy using NASA satellite imagery and data sets as integral resources. Students participating in the program gain a better understanding of the historical perspectives of global climate change research, the impacts of changes in environmental indicators, and the possible human consequences to predicted global climate change. They also practice applying research skills to locating relevant data, analyzing data to identify trends, and using data to support a position on environmental issues.</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>The sun provides the energy earth needs to survive and nothing is more important to life on earth than water. If water molecules didn’t behave the way they do, there would be no life on earth! The sun and water together do wonderful things in a cycle of movement. Let’s demonstrate some of these water cycle properties at home!

            Decorate the outside of a quart size resealable plastic bag with permanent marker to show the sun and clouds.
            Put a half cup of water (color with a drop or two of blue food coloring for fun) in your bag and close it tight!
            Place your bag in the freezer overnight. The next morning, hang your bag in a sunny window. Your liquid water has turned to a solid when below 32 degrees F. Note: solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water and thus it floats. This insulates the liquid water beneath the ice allowing for aquatic life to live in cold weather! What if ice sunk to the bottom? Lakes would freeze solid! If that happened there would be no fish!
            Wait until late afternoon and look at your bag in the window. Solid water has turned liquid again. Some liquid water turned into a gas and rose up high in the bag. Now liquid water is clinging to the sides of the bag up high and bigger water droplets are “raining” back down! In this cycle you saw water in solid, liquid and gas forms. No water was lost, it just moved around!
